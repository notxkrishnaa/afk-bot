• A topic and a belonging word list is presented, with a button attached to it\n
• If you are a player and press this button, one of the words of this list is presented to you (called the secret word) - everybody gets the same ofc. If you are the chameleon, you will be informed about this fact instead\n
• Now the bot asks one after another about a description of the secret word.\n
• If you are a player, try to describe the secret word in a way that the chameleon can't guess it; but other players know certainly that you are not the chameleon\n
• If you are the chameleon, you have to choose a description based on your very limited knowledge. Try to blend in with your choice!\n
• After everyone said a word, everybody gets to vote on who they think is the chameleon. The role of the one with the most votes gets unmasked\n
• If it is an ordinary player, the chameleon wins!
• If it is the chameleon, it will try to guess the secret word. If its guess is indeed correct, it still wins; otherwise the player do!"

deck: "Decks are collection of \"cards\". You can create new decks or change existing ones. They are simple json files. In case you create a new deck, keep in mind that you need to pass two keys: language and name. Language is the language the deck is in, name the name of your deck. Capitalize both. Inside the json file, you define keys, which are the topic of the words, and then create a list with fitting words. Only strings are allowed in the list. 16 words per topic are recommended, but not required. You can look at actual implementations {0} and join us over {1} in case you have questions or want to submit a file."
# the translation command reply
# {0} - {2} will be links, instead of the url will the translation of here be used. Tell the group if that's a problem
translation: "You can translate the whole bot :O The files are .yaml files, they should be edible in every basic text program, but Notepad ++ is a recommendation from me :) If you actually take on this challenge, you can find existing translations {0}. Once you download the base file (en is recommended, since its always the most updated file), rename it with the ISO 639-1 code of your language. The two letter one is recommended, but not enforced. Translate the parts in the quotation marks. In case you want to actually use quotation marks in your strings, escape them like that: <code>\\\"</code> . Let the curly brakes stay and don't change their number. Telegrams formatting is supported with html tags, they worked as described {1}. After you are finished, join us {2} to submit this file or to ask further questions."

fewer_help: "<b>Fewer</b>: If only three players are playing (and this is activated), the chameleon, if caught, gets two guesses."
more_help: "<b>More</b>: If 7 or 8 players are playing (and this is activated), the words vanish once everyone has said their word, making it harder for the chameleon to guess the correct one."
tournament_help: "<b>Tournament</b>: If this mode is activated, a scoring system is introduced. If the chameleon escapes undetected, it gets two points. If it gets caught and guesses the correct word, it gets one point. If it doesn't, the player get two points each. The first player making it to 5 points wins."
pin_help: "<b>Pin</b>: Once activated, I will silently pin the word list so players can find it easier once a game is started. I will pin the old pinned message (if existing) silently again when the game ends. In order to activate this setting, you need to make me an admin with pin privileges."
restrict_help: "<b>Restricting</b>: Once activated, I will restrict everyone from writing except the person whose turn it is during the word saying phase. Everyone can write again after this phase is over. In order for this to work, I will promote those users to admins with add member rights, since admins aren't restricted. The original chat permissions are restored after the phase. In order to activate this setting, you need to make me an admin with add new admins, restrict members and add members privileges. You can read up here if you want to know why: https://t.me/TheChameleonSupport/8\n<i>Attention:</i> Every message counts as word entry in the say-a-word-phase. The exclamation setting is completely ignored."
exclamation_help: "<b>Exclamation Mark</b>: The exclamation mark is a crucial part of the way your group plays this game. In the standard setting, this is deactivated, meaning that messages without a prepending exclamation mark are counted, while messages beginning with one are ignored. While it feels more natural, this behaviour can lead to false entries, when people continue a conversation they are having. You can change this to activated, which flips that behaviour around. Only messages with a prepending exclamation mark are counted. This feels a bit weird, but effectively eliminates the possibility of false entries.\n<i>Attention:</i> This setting is ignored when the game is in restricted mode, where it is not possible to have a conversation while the game is in the entry phase."
